# Step 12 PDH reconstruction

This branch reconstructs the reviewed Step 12 PDH model as a reproducible
stepwise sequence. The reference `frq`, `ini`, `tag`, age-length, regional
scaling, and MFCL configuration files are byte-identical to the corresponding
Step 12 files on `main`; the model differences are therefore confined to the
documented `doitall.sh` controls and fitted parameters.

## Step placement

| Step | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `04-NewStructure` | Keeps the first 5-region / 33-fishery model as the clean structural comparison. |
| `04a-SelectivityReview` | Adds the five reviewed fishery-level LF/selectivity controls without changing any data input. |
| `05`-`11` | Inherit `04a` and retain each step's original single change. |
| `12-OrthogonalPoly` | Adds OPR `72-01-50-50`, a two-calendar-year terminal window, and the terminal-recruitment penalty in final PHASE 11. |
| `13`-`15` | Inherit the reconstructed Step 12 controls and retain each later step's original change. |

## Reviewed LF/selectivity controls

| Fishery | Control | Fit rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F20 | `ff(16)=0`, `ff(3)=37` | Restore flexibility to predict observed large fish. |
| F28 | `ff(16)=0`, `ff(3)=37` | Restore flexibility to predict observed large fish. |
| F26 | `ff(75)=1` | Avoid predicting an unsupported age-class-1 catch. |
| F12 | `ff(75)=2` | Avoid predicting unsupported age-class-1 and age-class-2 catches. |
| F17 | `ff(16)=2`, `ff(3)=6` | Reduce over-prediction of large fish. |

These values reproduce the reference PDH PAR exactly. They are intentionally
not propagated to additional fisheries in this reconstruction.

## OPR and terminal recruitment

| Flag | Value | Role |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `pf155` | 72 | OPR year effect. |
| `pf217` | 1 | OPR season effect. |
| `pf216` | 50 | OPR region effect. |
| `pf218` | 50 | OPR region-season interaction. |
| `pf202` | 2 | Terminal window in calendar years: 8 quarters with `age_flag(57)=4`. |
| `pf397` | 100 | Activates the terminal-recruitment penalty in MFCL 2.2.7.9; effective coefficient is `100/10=10`. |

The base OPR controls are fitted through PHASE 10 with `pf397=0`. Final
PHASE 11 starts from `10.par`, sets `pf397=100`, and writes `11.par`; no
PHASE 12 or `12.par` is used. Its default evaluation ceiling is `20000`, which
can be reduced with `BET_PDH_TERMINAL_EVALUATIONS`. Convergence uses the same
`BET_PHASE10_11_CONVERGENCE` setting as every other final step (`-4` for the
planned parallel run; `-5` for a stricter reference comparison).

This shorter staging preserves the reviewed final controls but is not the
same optimizer path as the reference run, which added the penalty after an
unpenalized `11.par`. The objective and PDH status therefore need to be
confirmed from the new PHASE-11-only fit rather than assumed from the reference.

`pf221=72` is retained solely for reference-PAR parity. It is obsolete in the
reviewed source and does not change the verified MFCL 2.2.7.9 objective or
terminal penalty.

The fitted parameter values are not copied into earlier steps. This diagnostic
branch stores the reference PAR only under `12-OrthogonalPoly` and advances it
for one evaluation to create a clean checkpoint payload. Full-refit diagnostics
continue to use the preserved model inputs and phase sequence in `doitall.sh`.
