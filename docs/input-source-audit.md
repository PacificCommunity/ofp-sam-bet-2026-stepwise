# Input Source Audit

This page answers one question: after pulling the source input repos, what is
copied as-is and what is intentionally changed in the generated model folders?

## Short Answer

| Input | Source-exact? | Intentional generated change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.frq` | Yes for steps 01-12. | Steps 13-14 change only index-fishery effort values for effort creep. |
| `.tag` | Yes for all steps. | None. `tag_rep_map.R` is an audit file, not an MFCL input. |
| `.age_length` | Records are copied from source. | Steps 04-14 set effective sample size from `1` to `0.75`. |
| `.ini` | 01 and 02a are unchanged from source. Later steps are generated from source baselines. | MFCL 1007 conversion, BET 2026 L-W, `LN(R0)` from 04 onward, FixM, tag/RR alignment, and current-reader compatibility edits. |
| `bet.reg_scaling` | The full source matrix is copied for steps 08-14. | Parest flags 77-81 select rows 53-72 internally for the active prior window. |

## Source Repos Checked

| Repo | Current source commit | BET-side note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ofp-sam-2026-BET-YFT-frq-build` | `f89e066` | Latest pulled changes affect YFT files only; BET `.frq` sources used here are unchanged. |
| `ofp-sam-2026-BET-YFT-build-ini` | `386d169` | BET ini, mix-period ini, and RR summary files include corrected RR initial values. |
| `ofp-sam-2026-BET-YFT-tag-prep` | `471b2fd` | `bet.2026.low.recaps.removed.tag` and the 2023 new-structure tag source are used unchanged after the corrected RR group initial-value refresh. |
| `ofp-sam-2026-BET-YFT-age-length-build` | `a26b694` | Source CAAL records are used; generated files only change effective sample size. |

## By File Type

| File type | Steps | Source file | Generated difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.frq` | 01-12 | Selected source in `frq-build`, diagnostic repo, or archived 2023 replication inputs. | None found in byte-for-byte source checks. |
| `.frq` | 13-14 | `BET/bet.2026.new-strucure.regional-cpue.wt-as-len-plus-len.frq` | Effort values for index fisheries 29-33 are multiplied by the agreed effort-creep schedule. |
| `.tag` | 01-14 | Selected source `.tag` for each step family. | None. |
| `.age_length` | 01-03 | Diagnostic or archived 2023 replication source. | None. |
| `.age_length` | 04-08 | `BET/bet.2023.new-structure.age_length` | 112 effective-sample-size values change from `1` to `0.75`. |
| `.age_length` | 09-14 | `BET/bet.2026.age_length` | 181 effective-sample-size values change from `1` to `0.75`. |
| `bet.reg_scaling` | 08-14 | `BET/bet.2026.reg_scaling` | Full 292-period matrix copied unchanged; flags 77-81 select active rows 53-72 internally. |

## INI Edits

| Steps | Source baseline | Generated `.ini` edits | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | 2023 diagnostic `bet.ini` | No edit. | Keeps the historical diagnostic input exactly as run in 2023. |
| 02a | Archived 2023 replication `bet.ini` | No edit. The ini remains MFCL 1003 format. | Isolates the current executable effect before changing the ini layout. |
| 02b | 02a generated input | Sets ini version to `1007`; inserts 118 `# tag flags` rows with two-quarter mixing and `tag_flags(it,2)=0`; inserts a zero tag-shed vector; inserts MFCL 1007 defaults for `LN(R0)=25` and Richards growth parameter `0`. | Converts the 2023 replication ini into a current-reader layout without changing the assessment data. |
| 02c | 02b generated input | Changes `# Length-weight parameters` from `3.063397e-05 2.932384` to `3.073533e-05 2.932410`. `LN(R0)` remains `25`. | Isolates the BET 2026 bias-corrected L-W update before later structural changes. |
| 03 | 02c generated input | Replaces the `# age_pars` natural-mortality row with the fixed-M row from the 01 diagnostic `mgc=-5` final par. | Carries the chosen diagnostic M estimate and 02c L-W update into later current-executable runs. |
| 04-06 | `BET/bet.2023.new.structure.ini` from `ofp-sam-2026-BET-YFT-build-ini` commit `386d169` | Applies FixM, sets `LN(R0)=17`, applies the BET 2026 L-W values, and normalizes the `# tag flags` marker/format. The selected 2023 new-structure `.tag` from `ofp-sam-2026-BET-YFT-tag-prep` commit `471b2fd` has 96 release groups; the latest source `.ini` has 98 identical tag-control rows, so the generator trims the two extra tag-control rows to match the `.tag`. It also harmonizes grouped RR initial values only, leaving group flags, targets, and penalties unchanged. | Moves to the 5-region structure while keeping the intended tag treatment, fixed M, and 2026 L-W; native MFCL requires grouped reporting-rate starts to be equal. |
| 07-09 | `BET/bet.2026.ini`, plus RR blocks from `BET/ini.mix-period/bet.2026.mix-0.2.ini`, both from `ofp-sam-2026-BET-YFT-build-ini` commit `386d169` | Applies FixM and BET 2026 L-W; copies the five RR/active/target/penalty matrix blocks from the mix-period ini; keeps the latest 98 release-group tag/RR shape; sets all `tag_flags(it,2)` from source `1` to generated `0`; validates positive-recapture RR cells. Mixing remains two quarters for all 98 groups. | Aligns the 2026 tag file from `ofp-sam-2026-BET-YFT-tag-prep` commit `471b2fd` with the latest corrected 2026 ini/RR shape while keeping the 2023-style RR treatment during mixing. |
| 10-14 | `BET/ini.mix-period/bet.2026.mix-0.2.ini` from `ofp-sam-2026-BET-YFT-build-ini` commit `386d169` | Uses the latest mix-period ini as the base; applies FixM; keeps release-specific mixing where positive; sets all `tag_flags(it,2)` from source `1` to generated `0`; raises 2 source zero mixing periods to `1`; validates positive-recapture RR cells. | Uses release-specific mixing from the KS build but avoids zero-period values that the current MFCL reader rejects. |

Current tag-flag check:

| File | Release rows | Mixing-period column | `tag_flags(it,2)` column |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Source `bet.2023.new.structure.ini` | 98 tag-control rows for a 96-release-group tag file | all `2` | all `0` |
| Generated step 04 ini | 96 | all `2` | all `0` |
| Source `bet.2026.ini` | 98 | all `2` | all `1` |
| Generated step 07 ini | 98 | all `2` | all `0` |
| Source `bet.2026.mix-0.2.ini` | 98 | `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` release-specific values | all `1` |
| Generated step 10 ini | 98 | source `0` values raised to `1`; other values retained | all `0` |

With the latest upstream RR initial-value refresh, the generated 07-14 steps
validate that every positive tag recapture has nonzero RR, active, target, and
penalty cells without applying the older generated RR-start harmonization note.
The 04-06 new-structure transition can still harmonize grouped RR starts after
trimming the 98-row source tag-control block to the 96-release-group tag file.
This does not change reporting-rate group flags, targets, or penalties. The
older fishery 19 fallback repair remains in the generator only for older source
inputs that still need it; it is not the active change for this pull.

## Effort Creep Details

| Steps | Fisheries | Records changed | Rule |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 13-14 | 29-33 | 1,440 per step | 1%/yr for 1952-1976, then 0.5%/yr for 1977-2024. |

Only positive effort values are changed. Catch, size compositions, tag inputs,
and regional-scaling inputs are not changed by the effort-creep step.
