# BET 2026 stepwise model configuration.
#
# This is the main file to edit when adding, selecting, naming, or lightly
# changing model runs. Each row in `stepwise_models` points to one independent
# model folder under `steps/`.
# See README.md for the human-readable guide.
#
# Common launch examples:
#   STEP_SELECT=01-base-11par
#     Run only steps/01-base-11par.
#   STEP_SELECT=01-base-11par,03-review-11par
#     Run two independent model folders in one job.
#   STEP_SELECT=all
#     Run every row where enabled is TRUE.
#   MFCL_FEVALS=10
#     Override the per-row `fevals` value for one quick direct-MFCL test job.
#     This is automatically applied only for run_mode "last_par" or "single".
#     For run_mode "doitall", the value is passed to doitall.sh as the
#     environment variables MFCL_FEVALS and SMOKE_FEVALS, but the script must
#     explicitly use them.
#
# Folder convention:
#   steps/<step_id>/model/
#     Put that model's MFCL inputs here: .frq, .ini, .tag, .age_length, .par,
#     doitall.sh if needed, and any related model files.
#   steps/<step_id>/patch.R
#     Optional. Use only for a small scripted edit that should happen just
#     before MFCL runs.

stepwise_run <- list(
  # Default model folder used by `make local`, `make docker`, and `make kflow`
  # when STEP_SELECT is not supplied. Keep this narrow so adding new folders
  # does not accidentally run everything.
  default_step_select = "01-base-11par",

  # Label used to group the automatic stepwise -> plot -> report chain in Kflow.
  # Example: "bet-2026-e2e", "bet-2026-debug", "bet-2026-base-check".
  flow_group = "bet-2026-x111",

  # TRUE: command-line `make kflow` keeps the default dependency chain and
  # launches plot/report when stepwise succeeds.
  # FALSE: `make kflow` submits only the selected stepwise model job.
  # One-off override:
  #   make kflow TRIGGER_NEXT=false STEP_SELECT=01-base-11par
  trigger_next = TRUE,

  # Blank means use each row's `fevals`.
  # This controls the runner's quick-test -switch arguments for "last_par" and
  # "single" modes. It does not automatically modify a doitall.sh run.
  # In "doitall" mode, the value is only made available to the script as
  # MFCL_FEVALS/SMOKE_FEVALS.
  # Set a number here to override every selected row, for example:
  #   mfcl_fevals = "1"   # very quick smoke run
  #   mfcl_fevals = "50"  # longer local/cluster check
  mfcl_fevals = ""

# Model table.
#
# Add a new model by copying one row, changing `step_id`, and creating the
# matching folder under steps/. Keep labels short because they are reused in
# Kflow, plots, and summaries.
#
# Column guide:
#   step_id:
#     Folder name under `steps/`. Use numbered names so the intended order is
#     obvious, for example "04-steepness-low".
#   enabled:
#     TRUE to allow STEP_SELECT=all to run it. FALSE keeps the row documented
#     but skipped by all-mode.
#   model_label:
#     Human-readable short name for Kflow/plot/report labels.
#   run_mode:
#     "last_par"  Continue from the latest numbered .par and write the next one.
#                 Example: 11.par -> 12.par. This is the normal quick check.
#                 Uses `fevals` through runner-generated MFCL -switch arguments.
#     "single"    Use `input_par` and `output_par` exactly as listed.
#                 Uses `fevals` through runner-generated MFCL -switch arguments.
#     "doitall"   Run doitall.sh from the model folder, then keep the final .par.
#                 Does not automatically use `fevals`; doitall.sh must read
#                 MFCL_FEVALS/SMOKE_FEVALS if that behavior is wanted.
#   source_dir:
#     Blank means auto-detect `steps/<step_id>/model/`.
#     Use "." to use files directly in `steps/<step_id>/`.
#     Use a relative or absolute folder only for a deliberate shared source.
#   input_par:
#     Starting par file for "last_par" or "single"; use "latest" to auto-pick.
#   frq:
#     MFCL frequency file name, usually "bet.frq".
#   output_par:
#     Blank lets "last_par" choose the next numbered par.
#     Required for "single" if you want a precise output name.
#   fevals:
#     Quick test function evaluations for this row. Override with MFCL_FEVALS.
#     Applied by this runner only for "last_par" and "single"; only passed
#     through as an environment variable for "doitall".
#   notes:
#     Free text for humans. Use this to document why the model exists.
