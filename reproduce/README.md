# Saved stepwise fits

[standalone.zip](standalone.zip) is included in a normal clone. It contains
23 original final PARs, native inputs, `doitall.sh`, required nested fitting
settings, compact reference values and shared MFCL engines. The native archive
uses ordinary named files, with no Python reader or runtime.

From the repository root:

```sh
make list
make verify
make prepare CASE=20-Tau2Fixed OUT=/tmp/bet-inputs
make rerun CASE=20-Tau2Fixed OUT=/tmp/bet-native
```

Choose a fresh absolute OUT. Preparation and verification use base R plus system
archive/hash tools. `rerun` requires Linux x86-64: it uses the original ceiling-one
controls `1 1 1`, `1 50 0` and `1 246 1`. The evaluation convergence
criterion is 1; any nonzero iteration/function counter fails the check. It
compares the saved objective, case-specific parameter count,
dimensions and central REP values. Detailed outputs stay in OUT.
Use `CASE=all` for every saved case.

For a full fit:

```sh
make refit CASE=20-Tau2Fixed OUT=/tmp/bet-refit
```

This runs the preserved `doitall.sh` from the saved inputs. It is a longer fit,
not part of the saved-PAR CI checks. `models.csv` records each engine and the
refit-dependency status; unsupported full-fit cases refuse to run.

The ZIP can also be unzipped and used independently with its own Makefile.
`FILES.csv`, `models.csv` and `CONTENTS.sha256` bind the native files and reference
values. The original [native.tar.gz](native.tar.gz), [closure](closure.json) and
[validation policies](validation.json) remain available for provenance.
Historical externally executed binary identities remain unconfirmed.
Published report data and HTML links are unchanged.

Step 01 uses its preserved older engine; Steps 01–09 have five native input
files and omit `bet.reg_scaling`. The final case is `S0.90-F2-tau2-fixed`; its
source `bet.ini` and `bet.model.ini` are both retained as different files.

## Saved Hessians

[Model index](hessian-index.csv) lists the original Hessian files, final PARs and
checksums. Download only the required case:

```sh
make hessian CASE=01-Diag2023 OUT=/tmp/bet-hessian
```

Native part archives retain the original row blocks and matching final PAR.
They do not require another derivative calculation. `make hessian-verify` checks
the manifest; pass `CASE=... ARCHIVE=/absolute/model.tar.gz` to verify an offline archive.

All 23 cases are available: 22 original native Hessian part sets and the final
Diagnostic model's complete `bet.hes`. The index retains the published PDH indicators.

To assemble the saved parts with the pinned MFCL executable on
Linux x86-64:

```sh
make hessian-stitch-plan CASE=01-Diag2023
make hessian-stitch CASE=01-Diag2023 OUT=/tmp/bet-hessian-stitch
```

This uses switch `145=11`; original parts and PAR remain alongside the derived
`stitched/` files and `stitch.json` checks. The historical executable hash and
byte equality to the historical merged matrix are unconfirmed.

To calculate native derivatives again, use this recorded historical recipe.
Give each part a new directory with the matching `make restore` inputs,
executable and `final.par`. For a new fit, run `make refit` above and use its
last PAR as `final.par`. Check the parameter layout before reusing that case's
inclusive `row_bounds` in [hessians.json](hessians.json).

```sh
./mfclo64 bet.frq final.par hessian.par \
  -switch 3 1 145 1 1 223 FIRSTROW 1 224 LASTROW
```

Replace `FIRSTROW` and `LASTROW` with those bounds; repeat for every part.
Each writes `bet.hes` with `145=1`. `make hessian-stitch` uses saved parts only.
Use the restored older executable for `01-Diag2023`.
This derivative calculation has not been tested by CI.

Original records say `completed` with `nonzero_status`. The scanner labels them
`failed` for "Only one non zero slot in this sample", sometimes with tag reporting
warnings during mixing. These labels do not establish convergence; the published
PDH indicators remain unchanged.

## Original derivative logs

The optional archive keeps all 86 original native MFCL derivative logs,
including likelihood, penalty and row-progress traces. Restore them without
running MFCL:

```sh
make hessian-logs OUT=/absolute/bet-native-mfcl-logs
```

Files are arranged as `CASE/part_N/mfcl_hessian_log.txt`.
[native-logs.json](native-logs.json) records exact file hashes and matches each
part to the saved Hessian row bounds. Original execution-directory lines remain
in the logs. To check a downloaded archive, use
`make hessian-logs-verify ARCHIVE=/absolute/archive.tar.gz`.
