# BET 2026 Stepwise

<p align="right">
  <a href="kflow.yaml"><img src="kflow-ready.svg" alt="Kflow ready task"></a>
</p>

Kflow task for running numbered BET 2026 MFCL model folders and saving compact
model payloads for downstream results and report jobs.

## Workflow Role

```text
ofp-sam-bet-2026-stepwise -> ofp-sam-bet-2026-results -> ofp-sam-bet-2026-report
```

Each folder under `steps/` is an independent model run. Run one folder, a
comma-separated set, or all enabled rows.

## Edit Here

- `job-config.R`: model list, labels, defaults, input/output filenames, and
  evaluation counts.
- `steps/<step_id>/model/`: MFCL input files for one model.
- `steps/<step_id>/patch.R`: optional scripted edit before MFCL runs.

Run `make list` after editing `job-config.R`; it refreshes the generated README
tables and checks model folders.

## Run

```bash
make list
make local STEP_SELECT=all PROGRAM_PATH=/path/to/mfclo64
make docker STEP_SELECT=all
make kflow STEP_SELECT=all
make kflow STEP_SELECT=all TRIGGER_NEXT=false
make kflow-register-chain
```

Run several folders:

```bash
make kflow STEP_SELECT=03-RegFish,07-CAAL2026,12-DataWeight40
```

Refresh the Kflow task definitions after editing `kflow.yaml`:

```bash
export KFLOW_API_TOKEN=...
make kflow-register-chain
```

That reads each `kflow.yaml` from `KFLOW_CHAIN_REPOS` and upserts the matching
Kflow task registration. Override `KFLOW_CHAIN_REPOS` if the sibling repo paths
are different on a machine.

## Add A Model

1. Copy a folder under `steps/`.
2. Rename it with the next numbered ID, for example `13-SensitivityName`.
3. Put MFCL inputs in `steps/13-SensitivityName/model/`.
4. Add one row in `job-config.R`.
5. Run `make list`.
6. Launch with `STEP_SELECT=13-SensitivityName`.

| `setting` | `value` | `meaning` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default_step_select` | `all` | Model selection used when `STEP_SELECT` is not supplied. |
| `flow_group` | `bet-2026-stepwise-v2` | Kflow group label used to connect stepwise, results, and report jobs. |
| `trigger_next` | `true` | Whether command-line Kflow submissions keep the downstream results/report chain. |
| `mfcl_fevals` | `blank` | Blank uses the row-level `fevals` value; a number overrides selected rows. |
| `docker_image` | `ghcr.io/pacificcommunity/tuna-flow:v1.8` | Docker image used by Kflow and local Docker runs. |
| `program_path` | `/home/mfcl/mfclo64` | MFCL executable path inside the Docker image. |
| `stepwise_save_final_par` | `false` | Optional: copy the final `.par` back into `steps/<step_id>/model/`. Off by default; Kflow outputs always include `outputs/models/<step_id>/final.par`. |
| `stepwise_commit_final_pars` | `false` | Optional: create a narrow KflowBot commit containing saved final `.par` files. Off by default to avoid concurrent job push conflicts. |
| `stepwise_push_final_pars` | `false` | Optional: push the saved final `.par` commit to the current branch. Off by default. |
| `par_source_job` | `blank` | Optional previous Kflow job number/reference used with `RUN_MODE=job_par`. |
| `stepwise_par_source_dir` | `blank` | Optional local folder to search for previous output `.par` files when testing `RUN_MODE=job_par` outside Kflow. |
| `kflow_input_jobs` | `blank` | Optional Kflow input job number(s) to attach. For `.par` reruns, set this to the same previous same-step job as `PAR_SOURCE_JOB`. |

## Useful Kflow Config

| Field | Typical value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STEP_SELECT` | `12-DataWeight40` | Run one model folder. |
| `STEP_SELECT` | `03-RegFish,07-CAAL2026` | Run selected model folders. |
| `STEP_SELECT` | `all` | Run every enabled row. |
| `MFCL_FEVALS` | `10` | Override row-level `fevals`. |
| `MFCL_LIVE_LOG` | `true` | Stream MFCL output into the Kflow log. |
| `RUN_MODE` | `job_par` | Rerun from a previous Kflow job output `.par`. Use this with `PAR_SOURCE_JOB` and `KFLOW_INPUT_JOBS`. |
| `PAR_SOURCE_JOB` | `354` | Previous same-step job number to search for `outputs/models/<step_id>/final.par`. |
| `KFLOW_INPUT_JOBS` | `354` | Previous job number to attach as an input archive for the rerun. Usually the same value as `PAR_SOURCE_JOB`. |
| `INPUT_PAR` | `123.par` | Continue from one specific `.par` already in the selected model folder; if it is missing, the runner logs that and falls back to `doitall`. |
| `STEPWISE_COMMIT_FINAL_PARS` | `false` | Optional legacy path to commit final `.par` files back to this repo. Keep off for parallel Kflow runs. |
| `STEPWISE_PUSH_FINAL_PARS` | `false` | Optional legacy path to push the `.par` commit to GitHub. Keep off for parallel Kflow runs. |
| `TRIGGER_NEXT` | `false` | Stop after stepwise; do not launch results/report. |
| `FLOW_GROUP` | `bet-2026-base` | Shared label for the chain. |

## Outputs

Saved artifacts are intentionally compact:

```text
outputs/model-index.csv
outputs/selected-steps.csv
outputs/saved-pars.csv
outputs/models/<step_id>/model_payload.rds
outputs/models/<step_id>/model_payload_manifest.json
outputs/models/<step_id>/final.par
outputs/models/<step_id>/region-map/<region-map>.geojson
outputs/region-map/bet-2023-nine-region.geojson
outputs/region-map/bet-2026-five-region.geojson
```

Final `.par` files are archived in the Kflow output as
`outputs/models/<step_id>/final.par`. For a later rerun, set `RUN_MODE=job_par`,
set `PAR_SOURCE_JOB` to the previous same-step job number, and attach that same
job with `KFLOW_INPUT_JOBS`.

Bulky raw inputs and intermediate files such as `.frq`, `.tag`, and
`temporary_tag_report` are not kept in the Kflow artifact.

Map assets are stored once per spatial structure at the output root, and copied
into each model output so MFCL Shiny can find the right map whether it is opened
from a single stepwise job or from downstream results. Source assets live under
`assets/maps/`, and the runner copies only the structures needed by the selected
run:

- `bet-2023-nine-region.geojson` for the legacy 01/02 diagnostic/FixM models.
- `bet-2026-five-region.geojson` for the 03+ 5-region models. This file uses
  the 2026 BET label convention where old Region 4 is labelled Region 5 and old
  Region 5 is labelled Region 4.

Kflow also exposes an `MFCL Shiny` local app on stepwise jobs. Open it from a
completed model job to inspect the selected model payload directly, without
waiting for the downstream results/report tasks. The app runs in local Docker
on your computer and reads the compact payload from the submitter over SSH.
