## Snapshot

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Step folder | `steps/12f-OPRSeason5End3/model` |
| Status | Ready for Kflow smoke runs; full MFCL fit not run here. |

## Changes

| # | Change |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Uses the same inputs as 11-TimeVaryingCV. |
| 2 | Applies OPR sensitivity `69-05-50-50 end3`. |
| 3 | Keeps time-varying CPUE CV enabled for index fisheries 29-33. |
| 4 | OPR controls are applied in PHASE 3 of `doitall.sh`, including `2 177 0`. |

## Inputs

| File | Source / note |
| --- | --- |
| `.frq` | `bet.2026.new-strucure.regional-cpue.wt-as-len-plus-len.frq`, full 2024 with regional CPUE |
| `.ini` | `bet.2026.mix-0.2.ini`, FixM M row applied from the 01-Diag2023 mgc=-5 diagnostic final par; raised 2 zero tag mixing periods to 1 because MFCL >=2.2.7.5 disallows 0; normalized MFCL 1007 tag-control rows for 98 release groups |
| `.tag` | `bet.2026.low.recaps.removed.tag`; latest tag-prep build with updated RR groups and canneries-based reassignment of recaptures with missing gear to purse-seine fisheries before low-recap filtering |
| `.age_length` | `bet.2026.age_length` (updated CAAL); set age_length effective sample size to 0.75 for 181 records |
| `.reg_scaling` | Full `bet.2026.reg_scaling` global CPUE regional-scaling matrix; parest flags select active periods 53-72 (1965-1969) for the prior |
| `input_manifest.csv` | machine-readable source/input notes |

## Generated Input Changes

| Scope | Generated change | Unchanged |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.frq` | No generated edit; full 2024 regional-CPUE source is used. | Catch, effort, CPUE, and composition records from the selected source. |
| `.ini` | Uses release-specific mixing and latest RR/active/target/penalty matrices from `mix-0.2`, aligns tag-control rows to the selected tag release groups, sets `tag_flags(it,2)=0`, raises source zero mixing periods to `1`, applies fixed M, and validates positive recapture cells. | Positive release-specific mixing values and RR matrix structure. |
| `.tag` | No generated edit. | 2026 low-recapture-removed source tag file. |
| `.age_length` | Changes effective sample size from `1` to `0.75`. | 2026 CAAL records themselves. |

## Controls

| # | Control |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Time-varying CPUE CV flags are retained. |
| 2 | `1 149 0`, `1 398 0`, `1 400 0`, `2 177 0`, `2 32 0`, and `2 113 0` are applied at PHASE 3 for the OPR transfer. |
| 3 | `1 155 69`, `1 217 5`, `1 216 50`, and `1 218 50` set the OPR year, season, region, and region-season effects. |
| 4 | `2 30 1` is deliberately retained at the OPR phase because current MFCL requires `age_flag(30)=1` to activate the OPR polynomial coefficients. |
| 5 | `bet.reg_scaling` starts in PHASE 5; flags 77-81 configure the regional-scaling MVN prior with weight 50 (approximately CV 0.1). |
| 6 | The active prior window is periods 53-72 (1965-1969), derived from parest flags 79-80 for the 292-period model. |
| 7 | PHASE 1-4 retain CPUE_scaling; PHASE 5 switches to Prior_reg_biomass with index CPUE groups 29-33, fish flag 94 set to 0, and index selectivity groups 25-29. |
| 8 | Generated safeguards cover FRQ regions, MFCL 1007 tag blocks, shed rates, `age_flags(128)`, fail-fast `doitall.sh`, and the PHASE 10/11 env switch. |

## Run Notes

| # | Note |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | The latest `bet.2026.low.recaps.removed.tag` is kept, including the canneries missing-gear reassignment. |
| 2 | Release-specific mixing periods come from the mix-period `.ini`; generated `doitall.sh` removes the inherited `-9999 1 2` override. |
| 3 | Generation validates tag-control dimensions, shed rates, and reporting-rate matrices; source zero mixing periods are raised to 1 for the current MFCL reader. |
| 4 | Positive tag recapture RR, active, target, and penalty cells are validated after copying the latest RR groupings; the fishery 19 repair only remains as a fallback for older sources that still need it. |
| 5 | The OPR transfer uses sensitivity `69-05-50-50 end3` with terminal end window `3`. |

## Checks

| # | Check |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | After fitting, compare terminal recruitment and likelihood diagnostics against 11-TimeVaryingCV and 12-OrthogonalPoly. |
| 2 | Local MFCL `-makepar` smoke can still report nonzero tag recapture timing or fishery-realization warnings; review upstream tag prep before final production runs. |
