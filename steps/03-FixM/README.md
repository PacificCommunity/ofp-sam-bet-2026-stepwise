## Controls

| # | Control |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | The current MFCL executable configured by the runtime is used. |
| 2 | MFCL 1007 `# tag flags` supply tag mixing periods; the inherited `-9999 1 2` doitall override is removed. |
| 3 | The 2023 nine-region GeoJSON asset remains display-only; it does not change MFCL inputs. |
| 4 | Generated safeguards cover FRQ regions, MFCL 1007 tag blocks, shed rates, `age_flags(128)`, fail-fast `doitall.sh`, and the PHASE 10/11 env switch. |

## Checks

| # | Check |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Compare directly with 02c-LengthWeight to isolate this substep's change. |
| 2 | No fishery, tag, CAAL, or CPUE update is intended in this step. |
