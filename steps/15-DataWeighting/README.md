# 15 DataWeighting

Initial selective data-weighting step after the effort-creep model.

## Snapshot

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Step folder | `steps/15-DataWeighting/model` |
| Status | Ready for Kflow smoke runs; full MFCL fit not run here. |

## Changes

| # | Change |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Uses the same effort-creep `.frq`, mix-period `.ini`, tag, and CAAL as 14-EffortCreep. |
| 2 | Keeps time-varying CPUE CV, OPR, and length-based selectivity controls. |
| 3 | Applies the currently implemented size-composition data-weighting control change. |

## Inputs

| File | Source / note |
| --- | --- |
| `.frq` | `bet.2026.new-strucure.regional-cpue.wt-as-len-plus-len.frq`, full 2024 with regional CPUE, with index effort creep applied |
| `.ini` | `bet.2026.mix-0.2.ini`, FixM M row applied from 01-Diag2023 mgc=-5 final.par from Kflow job 000604; raised 41 zero tag mixing periods to 1 because MFCL >=2.2.7.5 disallows 0; normalized MFCL 1007 tag-control rows for 98 release groups |
| `.tag` | `bet.2026.low.recaps.removed.tag`; latest tag-prep build, including canneries-based reassignment of recaptures with missing gear to purse-seine fisheries before low-recap filtering |
| `.age_length` | `bet.2026.age_length` (updated CAAL); set age_length effective sample size to 0.75 for 181 records |
| `.reg_scaling` | `bet.2026.reg_scaling` global CPUE regional-scaling matrix, 292 quarterly rows x 5 regions |
| `input_manifest.csv` | machine-readable source/input notes |

## Controls

| # | Control |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 14-EffortCreep controls are retained. |
| 2 | `-999 49 40` and `-999 50 40` replace the global LF/WF divisor-20 settings. |
| 3 | Fishery-specific divisor-40 settings inherited from the 5-region controls are retained. |
| 4 | `bet.reg_scaling` starts in PHASE 5; flags 77-81 configure the regional-scaling MVN prior with weight 50 (approximately CV 0.1). |
| 5 | The active prior window is periods 53-72 (1965-1969), derived from parest flags 79-80 for the 292-period model. |
| 6 | PHASE 1-4 retain CPUE_scaling; PHASE 5 switches to Prior_reg_biomass with index CPUE groups 29-33, fish flag 94 set to 0, and index selectivity groups 25-29. |
| 7 | Generated safeguards cover FRQ regions, MFCL 1007 tag blocks, shed rates, `age_flags(128)`, fail-fast `doitall.sh`, and the PHASE 10/11 env switch. |

## Run Notes

| # | Note |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | The latest `bet.2026.low.recaps.removed.tag` is kept, including the canneries missing-gear reassignment. |
| 2 | Release-specific mixing periods come from the mix-period `.ini`; generated `doitall.sh` removes the inherited `-9999 1 2` override. |
| 3 | Generation validates tag-control dimensions, shed rates, and reporting-rate matrices; source zero mixing periods are raised to 1 for the current MFCL reader. |
| 4 | The implemented data-weighting change is the existing runnable control path: global LF/WF sample-size divisors are changed from 20 to 40. |

## Checks

| # | Check |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | This is a first runnable weighting scenario; targeted weighting by small-catch strata can be refined after diagnostics. |
| 2 | Review likelihood and composition residuals before treating this as the final tuned weighting scheme. |
| 3 | Local MFCL `-makepar` smoke can still report nonzero tag recapture timing or fishery-realization warnings; review upstream tag prep before final production runs. |
