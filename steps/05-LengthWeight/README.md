| Status | Ready for Kflow smoke runs; full MFCL fit not run here. |

## Changes

| # | Change |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Inherits the diagnostic-side 2023 assessment replication model from `04-FixM`. |
| 2 | Sets the BET bias-corrected 2026 length-weight parameters to `3.073533e-05 2.932410`. |
| 3 | Applies the FixM M-scale row from the 01-Diag2023 mgc=-5 diagnostic final par with value -2.54930339768360e+00 |

## Inputs

| File | Source / note |
| --- | --- |
| `.frq` | `steps/04-FixM/model/bet.frq` |
| `.ini` | `steps/04-FixM/model/bet.ini`; set Length-weight parameters from `3.063397e-05 2.932384` to `3.073533e-05 2.932410`; Fixed Lorenzen natural-mortality intercept applied from the 01-Diag2023 mgc=-5 diagnostic final par |
| `.tag` | `steps/04-FixM/model/bet.tag` |
| `.age_length` | `steps/04-FixM/model/bet.age_length` |
| `input_manifest.csv` | machine-readable source/input notes with source commits |

## Generated Input Changes

| Scope | Generated change | Unchanged |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.ini` | Changes only `# Length-weight parameters` to `3.073533e-05 2.932410`. | All other `04-FixM` ini controls. |
| `.frq/.tag/.age_length` | No generated edit. | Inherited from `04-FixM`. |

## Controls

| # | Control |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | The current MFCL executable configured by the runtime is used. |
| 2 | MFCL 1007 `# tag flags` supply tag mixing periods; the inherited `-9999 1 2` doitall override is removed. |
| 3 | The 2023 nine-region GeoJSON asset remains display-only; it does not change MFCL inputs. |
| 4 | Generated safeguards cover FRQ regions, MFCL 1007 tag blocks, shed rates, `age_flags(128)`, fail-fast `doitall.sh`, and the PHASE 10/11 env switch. |

## Checks

| # | Check |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Compare directly with 04-FixM to isolate this substep's change. |
| 2 | No fishery, tag, CAAL, or CPUE update is intended in this step. |
